 Library" means either the Library/code or any derivative work under
 copyright law.

 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it including any associated interface
 definition files, and scripts used to control compilation and
 installation of the library.

    source code repository maintained by Rensselaer Polytechnic
    Institute.  The mechanics of the submission are explained in the
    file named CONTRIBUTE distributed with the Library. Should you
    decide to submit the changes, you agree to provide Rensselaer
    Polytechnic Institute with a joint copyright assignment of the
    changes, and you agree to sign such a copyright assignment form at
    the request of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Changes will then
