Description: Molecular Dynamics Simulator
 LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics code, and an acronym for Large-scale
 Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator.
 .
 LAMMPS has potentials for soft materials (biomolecules, polymers) and
 solid-state materials (metals, semiconductors) and coarse-grained or
 mesoscopic systems. It can be used to model atoms or, more generically, as a
 parallel particle simulator at the atomic, meso, or continuum scale.
 .
 LAMMPS runs on single processors or in parallel using message-passing
 techniques and a spatial-decomposition of the simulation domain. The code is
 designed to be easy to modify or extend with new functionality.
