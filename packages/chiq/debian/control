Description: This package solves the Bethe-Salpeter equation
 (BSE) in the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and calculates
 the momentum-dependent static and dynamical susceptibilities 
 χ(q,ν_m) in correlated electron systems. Necessary input to
 this package can be generated using DCore. Combined with DCore,
 this package offers investigations of two-particle responses
 in models and materials.
